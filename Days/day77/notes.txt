Learning Points and Summary

- Using nested loops to remove unwanted characters from multiple columns
- Filtering Pandas DataFrames based on multiple conditions using both .loc[] 
and .query()
- Creating bubble charts using the Seaborn Library
- Style Seaborn charts using the pre-built styles and by modifying
 the Matplotlib parameters
 - Use floor division (i.e., integer division) to convert years to decades
 - Use Seaborn to superimpose a linear regression over our data
 - Make a judgement if our regression is good or bad based on how well
 the model fits our data and the r-squared metric
 - Run regression with scikit-learn and calculate the coefficients
