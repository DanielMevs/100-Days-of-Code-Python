What is REST?
L>Representational state transfer
L> Client Server architecture
L>Client makes a request or requests to the Server
L> Server looks at the request(s) and sends back a response
L> HTTP Request: hyertext transfer protocol request
L> FTP Request: file transfer request 
L> HTTPS: http secure request (encrypting request in transit s.t. others on
the internet do not have access to data)
L> A server will have a whole bunch of APIs which are services that it 
can expose for clients to be able to tap into.

Restaurent Analogy
The client is like the customer/patron 
Server is like the server in the restaurent that takes your order
The order is a request
The menu is like the API

What does it mean for our app to have a RESTful API?
L> REST is an architectural style for designing APIs
L> Before REST, SOAP used to be popular
L> Other styles include GraphQL and Falcor
L> A standard structure for all websites to build their APIs
L> Uses HTTP Request Verbs (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, PUT, etc...)
L> Uses specific pattern of routes/endpoint urls
L> In our server, we can specify specific routes or URL's in order
to access certain resources.
L> There are routing rules for all the items in a database or individual resources
