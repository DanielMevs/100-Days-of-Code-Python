Color Theory

Red = Intensity, Love, Energy
Yellow = Joy, Intellect, Attention
Green = Growth, Freshness, Safety
Blue = Stability, trust, serenity
Purple = Royalty, Wealth, Femininity

Analogous Colors
L> Taking two colors that are next to each other on the color wheel/palette
L>Con: not the best for standing out 

Complimentary Color palette
L>Used to make message "pop"
L> Con: Styling text and text background can look jarring.

Triadic Color palette
L> Drawing an equilateral triangle on the color palette and using color at edges
L> Similiar concept with a square.

Typography

Fonts matter, mkay

Serif: inspired by marble from antiquity
L>Characterized by serious, authoritative look
L>Feet of letter are flat
L> Can be found in a letter head/architectural design magazine
L> To advertize things that are considered aged and refined
L>Traditional, stable, respectable
L>Used more for titles/headings

San-Serif
L>Like serif but without the Feet
L>Used to convey approachability; more contemporary/modern
L> Sensible, simple, straightforward
L> Used more for body text
L> Considered more readable i.e. Verdana

They did an experiment where they timed how long a control group of drivers
would take between looking down at the dashboard, gathering and processing the information 
they were looking for, and looking back up at the road. They found just by changing the 
font from San-Serif Grotesque to Sans-Serif Humanist, they were able to dramatically reduce
this time (by 30-40%). That difference may be the difference between life and death.
Readability counts. The more your audience reads, the more likely they're going to buy 
into your product.

General rules of thumb
Similar moods
Stick to 2 Fonts
Consider time Era
Contrast Serif-ness (creates interest in your design)
Weights (bold heading, body can be thin/light)

User Interface design

Bigger, bolder, square things are more noticalbe to the human brain
Designers use this knowledge to define hierarchy
Ways we can establish hierarchy include:
- Color
L>Colors that pop out and stand out and have contrast with their
background tend to be used for high hierarchy
- Size
L>The first thing/attention grabber the user want you to see first will tend to 
be bigger than the rest of the text of the screen.
- Layout
L>You can create more interest by creating a block of text and then interspersed 
with pictures and then create different sizes, shapes and hierarchies to make
your design more interesting.
L>There is an optimal line length. Too long and it get too tedious to read.
Too short and it's a bit choppy.
L> Aim for about 40-60 characters per line so it feels comfortable to the user
L> Easiest way to make your design look professional is to reduce the number
of alignment points.
L> Use the grid lines in your design to help you visualize where the starting points
of each element is and try to line the all up.
- White Space
L> A lot of luxury shope/designer stores inject white space around their products
L> Spacing things out suddenly makes things look more expensive
L> Spacing items close together makes it look more like a discount store.
L> By adding white-space in your design, you can make your design look a lot more
minimalist and elevate it at the same time.
- Audience
L> Let's say your designing a children's concert. What would appeal to them and convey
to them that it's going to be of interest to them. 
L> Create a different style for different people tailored to their unique tastes.

- User Experience Design (UX)

The difference between user experience and design
L> Design we often think of having an aesthetic, what 
we think looks good and enforcing that on the user
L> User experience is meant to be invisible
L> Good user experience is achieved when a website
is meant to be unobtrusive and lets you do your thing
L> Feels like everything is easier and effortless
L> These 5 Ways You can produce this effect:
1 - Simplicity
Simple is better than complex and cluttered. 
2 - Consistency
Keep your designs consistent but also keep the functionality of your
product consistent. 
Inconsistency means that a user is going to be confused when they hae to go from
one part of the website to another, having to relearn how to use your website.
3 - Take into account People's Reading Patterns
Scientists have researched how human eyes track a webpage and which parts they look
at when they're browsing. 
One of the ost common reading patterns is called the F-pattern where the eye starts
at the top left of the corner and then it tracks the right and then it flips back again,
browsing down to the left gutter.
Another common pattern is the Z-pattern where our eyes go from left to right and then 
zig-zag down all the way the down the website.
