Color Theory

Red = Intensity, Love, Energy
Yellow = Joy, Intellect, Attention
Green = Growth, Freshness, Safety
Blue = Stability, trust, serenity
Purple = Royalty, Wealth, Femininity

Analogous Colors
L> Taking two colors that are next to each other on the color wheel/palette
L>Con: not the best for standing out 

Complimentary Color palette
L>Used to make message "pop"
L> Con: Styling text and text background can look jarring.

Triadic Color palette
L> Drawing an equilateral triangle on the color palette and using color at edges
L> Similiar concept with a square.

Typography

Fonts matter, mkay

Serif: inspired by marble from antiquity
L>Characterized by serious, authoritative look
L>Feet of letter are flat
L> Can be found in a letter head/architectural design magazine
L> To advertize things that are considered aged and refined
L>Traditional, stable, respectable
L>Used more for titles/headings

San-Serif
L>Like serif but without the Feet
L>Used to convey approachability; more contemporary/modern
L> Sensible, simple, straightforward
L> Used more for body text
L> Considered more readable i.e. Verdana

They did an experiment where they timed how long a control group of drivers
would take between looking down at the dashboard, gathering and processing the information 
they were looking for, and looking back up at the road. They found just by changing the 
font from San-Serif Grotesque to Sans-Serif Humanist, they were able to dramatically reduce
this time (by 30-40%). That difference may be the difference between life and death.
Readability counts. The more your audience reads, the more likely they're going to buy 
into your product.

General rules of thumb
Similar moods
Stick to 2 Fonts
Consider time Era
Contrast Serif-ness (creates interest in your design)
Weights (bold heading, body can be thin/light)

User Interface design

Bigger, bolder, square things are more noticalbe to the human brain
Designers use this knowledge to define hierarchy
Ways we can establish hierarchy include:
- Color
L>Colors that pop out and stand out and have contrast with their
background tend to be used for high hierarchy
- Size
L>The first thing/attention grabber the user want you to see first will tend to 
be bigger than the rest of the text of the screen.
- Layout
L>You can create more interest by creating a block of text and then interspersed 
with pictures and then create different sizes, shapes and hierarchies to make
your design more interesting.
L>There is an optimal line length. Too long and it get too tedious to read.
Too short and it's a bit choppy.
L> Aim for about 40-60 characters per line so it feels comfortable to the user
L> Easiest way to make your design look professional is to reduce the number
of alignment points.
L> Use the grid lines in your design to help you visualize where the starting points
of each element is and try to line the all up.
- White Space
L> A lot of luxury shope/designer stores inject white space around their products
L> Spacing things out suddenly makes things look more expensive
L> Spacing items close together makes it look more like a discount store.
L> By adding white-space in your design, you can make your design look a lot more
minimalist and elevate it at the same time.
- Audience
L> Let's say your designing a children's concert. What would appeal to them and convey
to them that it's going to be of interest to them. 
L> Create a different style for different people tailored to their unique tastes.
