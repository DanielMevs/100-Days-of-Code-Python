They did an experiment where they timed how long a control group of drivers
would take between looking down at the dashboard, gathering and processing the information 
they were looking for, and looking back up at the road. They found just by changing the 
font from San-Serif Grotesque to Sans-Serif Humanist, they were able to dramatically reduce
this time (by 30-40%). That difference may be the difference between life and death.
Readability counts. The more your audience reads, the more likely they're going to buy 
into your product.
