From AppBrewery founder Angela Yu, [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) boasts one of the highest ratings on Udemy. Completing this course gave me an opportunity to apply my Python knowledge that I've accumulated over time. In the process of building professional, thought-provoking applications, I deepened my understanding of beginner, intermediate and advanced topics which greatly helped advance my journey to mastery. I now have a much firmer grasp on GUI development, Web development, automation, and data science. Very beginner-friendly and engaging, Angela makes her lessons fun, providing the right amount of challenge. I highly recommend this course for anyone looking to develop their Python skills.
