From AppBrewery founder Angela Yu, [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) boasts one of the highest ratings on Udemy. Completing this course gave me an opportunity to apply the knowledge I've accumulated over time. In the process of building professional, thought-provoking applications, I deepened my understanding of beginner, intermediate and advanced topics which greatly helped advance my journey to mastery. Very beginner friendly and engaging, Angela makes her lessons fun, providing the right amount of challenge. I highly recommend this course for anyone looking to develop their Python skills.
